# Terminal tutorial:

**Windows:** start menu --> Windows System --> Command Prompt

**Mac:** Command + Space, "terminal"

## Commands - SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ON MAC AND WINDOWS!

### The MAC version:

`pwd` -- print working directory (this is the directory you're in)

`ls` -- list contents of current directory (if followed by a dir name, will list contents of that dir)

`cd` -- change directory (if on its own, will change you to home dir; if you follow it with a dir name, will change to that dir)

`mkdir` -- make directory (follow it with a directory name)

`rmdir` -- remove directory (PERMANENT! follow it with a filename)

`touch` -- make a file (follow it with a filename)

`rm` -- remove a file (PERMANENT! follow it with a filename)

### The WINDOWS version:

`cd ,` -- print working directory (this is the directory you're in)

`dir` -- list contents of current directory (if followed by a dir name, will list contents of that dir)

`cd` -- change directory (if on its own, will change you to home dir; if you follow it with a dir name, will change to that dir)

`mkdir` -- make directory (follow it with a directory name)

`rmdir` -- remove directory (PERMANENT! follow it with a filename)

`del /f` -- remove a file (PERMANENT! follow it with a filename)


## Danger!

- Everything is permanent, there is no "Trash Bin"
- `sudo rm -rf *` will remove your entire filesystem.
